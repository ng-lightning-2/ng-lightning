Dropdowns offer items that the user can choose from.

Add the `nglDropdown` directive to the `<div>` that wraps the dropdown list.

Use the `nglDropdownTrigger` directive to any child element, usually a `<button>` or a `<a>`, to open or close the dropdown.
Add the `nglDropdownItem` directive on any child element that constitutes a dropdown item.

**Accessibility and Keyboard interactions**:

  * `Space` and `Enter` on an `nglDropdownTrigger` toggle the dropdown's open status
  * `DownArrow` on an `nglDropdownTrigger` opens the dropdown and moves focus to the first dropdown item
  * An open `nglDropdown` has `aria-selected="true"` and a closed one has `aria-selected="false"`
  * `DownArrow` and `UpArrow` on an open `nglDropdown` move focus to the next and previous items respectively
  * `Escape` closes an open `nglDropdown` and moves focus to the `nglDropdownTrigger`
  * `Tab` closes an open `nglDropdown` and moves focus to the next focusable element
