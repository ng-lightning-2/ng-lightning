Alert banners communicate a state that affects the entire system, not just a feature or page. It persists over a session and appears without the user initiating the action.
By default, alerts are shown relative to where they have been specified in markup. For *fixed-to-the-top* just place them inside a `<div>` decorated with the `'slds-notify_container'` class.
You can bind to `(close)` to be apprised of when the close button has been clicked.
You can set the `[duration]` attribute to a positive integer (in milliseconds, including 0) to set a timeout for automatically closing. If the binding changes, any previous timeout is canceled and if the new binding is valid as described above, a new timeout is set to that number.
