You can use <span class="code">min</span> and <span class="code">max</span> properties in order to enforce validation on the input and disable all dates on the calendar popup before or after the respective values. Another way to add date validation is using the <span class="code">dateDisabled</span> property, that accepts a function that returns <span class="code">true</span> if date is invalid and <span class="code">false</span> otherwise. Again this will also disable the dates on the calendar that are invalid. However, one important difference between using <span class="code">dateDisabled</span> vs using <span class="code">min</span> or <span class="code">max</span> is that filtering out all dates before or after a certain point, will not prevent the user from advancing the calendar past that point.
