A `<ngl-icon>` is a visual element that provides context and enhances usability. Icons can be used inside the body of another component or on their own.

All available icons can be found [here](https://lightningdesignsystem.com/icons).

Use the `variant` and `size` to customize the styling. The `variant` input changes the appearance of a utility icon. For example, the *error* variant adds a red fill.

If you want to make additional changes to the color or styling of an icon, use the `svgClass` input (similar to `ngClass`)  to apply extra classes to the SVG element.

**Changing the default behavior**
You can configure your app's default path to SVG icons by configuring and providing your options using the `NGL_ICON_CONFIG` injection token.
