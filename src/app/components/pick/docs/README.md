Make a group of elements behave like a set of radio buttons by using `nglPick` and `nglPickOption`. You can alternatively make them behave like a set of checkboxes, by attaching the `nglPickMultiple` directive.

If you need to specify a custom class when the element is currently selected you can define the `nglPickActiveClass` property either on the host element of `nglPick` or on each `nglPickOption` if you want to override it.
