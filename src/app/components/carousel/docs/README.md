A `<ngl-carousel>` allows multiple pieces of featured content to occupy an allocated amount of space.

Only one `<ngl-carousel-image>` is displayed at a time, and you can select others by clicking the carousel indicators.

The carousel auto scrolls by default and loops through the images repeatedly. A button on the lower left enables you to pause and restart scrolling. Disable auto scrolling by setting the `autoScroll="false"` in the `ngl-carousel` tag. Disable continuous looping by setting the `autoRefresh="false"`.
