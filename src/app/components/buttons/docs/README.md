Buttons are clickable items used to perform an action.

You can create buttons in several ways: a button with a label only, or a button with a label and icon. For an icon-only button, use `ngButtonIcon` instead.

Use the `variant` input to apply additional styling.

A `nglButtonStateful` represents a button that toggles between states, similar to a like button on social media. Stateful buttons can show a different label and icon based on their states.
