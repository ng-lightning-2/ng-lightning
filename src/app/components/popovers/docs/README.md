A popover is a non-modal dialog. The component should be paired with a clickable trigger element and contain at least one focusable element.

The popover directives support multiple placements.

Use a `string` or a `<ng-template #ref>` to host your popover's content, header and footer. `#` reference will be later used to "connect" with the desired `nglPopover` directive and `nglPopoverHeader`, `nglPopoverFooter` inputs.
